# Time-Series-Analysis-with-Non-Linear-Models-for-Energy-Consumption-Prediction
This project examines the effectiveness of advanced non-linear models (XGBoost and LSTM) in forecasting India's national hourly electricity demand. A high-performance Linear Regression model is used as a benchmark to evaluate the non-linear models' ability to capture complex patterns beyond robust feature engineering.
